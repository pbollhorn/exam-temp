# BI Exam Project: Machine Learning for a Fictional Movie Streaming Company

Group members:
- Peter Bollhorn
- Tobias Thormod Birk Nielsen

In our exam project we will work with MovieStream, which is a fictional company that runs an online movie streaming platform.

MovieStream streams both its own movies as well as external movies (similar to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max).

We will address two challenges:
- Movie Recommendations: Which movies should MovieStream recommend to the users of its platform?
- Movie Profit: Which new movies should MovieStream produce in order to make the highest profit?


## Movie Recommendations
It is normal for streaming platforms to give personalized content recommendations to their users, because they want to keep their users engaged by showing them content they're likely to enjoy. These personalized recommendations can be generated using various methods:






| Method                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                           |
|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content-Based Filtering (CBF)             | Recommends movies by looking at the attributes of the movies which the user has already enjoyed (e.g., genre, actors, director) and suggest other movies with similar characteristics.|
| Collaborative Filtering (CF)              | User-Based CF: Recommends movies by looking at users who have enjoyed the same movies as you, and then suggest you other movies they have enjoyed.<br> Item-Based CF:                 |
| Matrix Factorization                      | (A more advanced method)  |
| Deep Learning-Based Recommendations       | (A more advanced method)  |
| Hybrid Systems                            | Combinations of the above methods
