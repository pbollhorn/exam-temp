# BI Exam Project: Machine Learning for a Fictional Movie Streaming Company

Group members:
- Peter Bollhorn
- Tobias Thormod Birk Nielsen

In our exam project we will work with MovieStream, which is a fictional company that runs an online movie streaming platform.
MovieStream streams both its own movies as well as external movies.
So MovieStream is similar to companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max.

We will address two challenges:
- Movie Recommendations: Which movies should MovieStream recommend to the users of its platform?
- Movie Profit: Which new movies should MovieStream produce in order to make the highest profit?


## Movie Recommendations
It is normal for streaming platforms to give personalized content recommendations to their users, because they want to keep their users engaged by showing them content they're likely to enjoy. These personalized recommendations can be generated in various ways:
⦁	Collaborative Filtering (CF)
⦁	Content-Based Filtering (CBF)
⦁	Matrix Factorization
⦁	Deep Learning-Based Recommendations
⦁	Hybrid Systems
